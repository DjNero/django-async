 Make the back off of failed jobs more even. They start off further apart and then don't delay so quickly. The formula is now 1 minute * the number of failures raised to the power 1.6.
 Made some improvements to the health output.

 There is a new deschedule API which allows us to take jobs out of the queue by marking them as already executed.
 Record the time that job execution starts and also allow us to set a priority for jobs.

 We can now call Python built in functions as scheduled jobs.
 The Job result field needs to allow blank so that Django admin edits work as expected.
 Added a Slumber server operation that allows us to schedule new jobs.

 Added in simple queue health API that will allow us to track the queue is running properly.
 Class methods can now also be scheduled properly.
 Flush queue also prints the job ID number.
 Jobs can't be callable because then admin keeps calling them :(
 Sorted out the display of the jobs and errors in admin.
